# Crohn-s-Disease-WES-meta
Meta analysis of Crohn's Disease whole exome sequencing study (Sequencing of over 100,000 individuals 
identifies multiple genes and rare variants associated with Crohn’s disease susceptibility, https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.15.21258641v1)

We performed the meta analysis of two Whole Exome Sequencing dataset, Nextera and TWIST with metal 
(Willer, C. J., Li, Y., & Abecasis, G. R. (2010). Bioinformatics, 26(17), 2190–2191).
