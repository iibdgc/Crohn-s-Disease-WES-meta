# Large-scale sequencing identifies multiple genes and rare variants associated with Crohnâ€™s disease susceptibility

## Synopsis
IBD exome-wide assocaition statistics from the meta-analysis of two callsets: Nextera and Twist. We used the fixed-effect meta-analysis in [METAL](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2922887/). Column headers are self-explanatory. Allele2 is the tested/effect allele.
